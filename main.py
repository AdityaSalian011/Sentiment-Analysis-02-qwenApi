    Context: 
    - The review is from the domain {domain.upper()}.
    - Always use "{actor}" when rewriting sentences in the third-person perspective.
    
    INSTRUCTIONS FOR STRICT PYTHON DICTIONARY GENERATION:

    IMPORTANT RULE:
    - You must ONLY use information explicitly present in the review.
    - Do NOT invent, assume, or add any detail that is not directly stated.

    Bad Example (hallucination):
    Review: "Fabulous experience"
    Output: {{"sentence1": "{actor} had a fantastic time.", "sentence2": "The service was impeccable.", "sentence3": "The food exceeded expectations."}}
    
    Good Example (faithful):
    Review: "Fabulous experience"
    Output: {{"sentence1": "{actor} had a fabulous experience.", "sentence2": "", "sentence3": ""}}

    TASK OVERVIEW:
    1.  You are a highly skilled data extraction specialist.
    2.  Your task is to analyze a user review and extract a MAXIMUM of 3 MEANINGFUL sentences that reflect the given sentiment.
    3.  Each extracted sentence must be a complete thought, be written in the THIRD-PERSON perspective, and PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL SENTIMENT OF THE REVIEW.
    4.  The output MUST strictly adhere to the specified Python dictionary format.
    
    # PROCESSING STEPS
    
    Step 1: Analyze the Review
    -   Read the provided review carefully.
    -   Identify the PRIMARY sentiment expressed: negative, positive, or neutral.
    -   Take note of specific nouns, actions, and descriptive language that support this sentiment.
    
    Step 2: Extract Core Ideas
    -   From the review, select up to three DISTINCT and NON-REDUNDANT pieces of information.
    -   Prioritize sentences that contain specific details (e.g., names, actions, reasons) over general statements.
    -   Preferentially select sentences that EXPLAIN *why* the sentiment is present (e.g., "The soup was cold" is better than "The food was bad").
    
    Step 3: Rewrite in Third Person
    -   Convert all first-person singular pronouns (`I`, `my`) to "{actor}".
    -   Convert all first-person plural pronouns (`we`, `our`) to "{actor}s".
    -   Retain the original punctuation and capitalization.
    -   Preserve the emotional intensity and nuance of the original statement.
    
    Step 4: Format the Output
    -   Create a Python dictionary with exactly three keys: `sentence1`, `sentence2`, and `sentence3`.
    -   Each value should be a string containing one of your extracted and rewritten sentences.
    -   If the review contains fewer than three distinct points, leave the remaining keys as empty strings (`""`).
    -   Your ONLY output should be the dictionary. Do NOT include any explanations, code fences, or additional text.
    
    # SPECIFICATIONS
    
    -   Sentence Length: Aim for a natural sentence length between 10 and 20 words. Do not force an exact count.
    -   Redundancy: Ensure each sentence provides a unique piece of information. Do NOT repeat ideas [[8]].
    -   Accuracy: Do NOT invent or generalize information. Only include details explicitly stated in the review.
    -   Formatting: The final output must be a SINGLE, valid Python dictionary printed exactly as shown in the examples.
